The Interface and access mode is glitch free IDLE is a lifesaver on Hacker Earth. The users easily access the portal and the support guide is also very efficient. There isn't any lagging issue and smoothness is also a key to keep in mind if it's on Hacker Earth.Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

In hacker earth assessments there are many featuers like light and dark mode which is comfortable during the assessments and also there is the autocomplete feature which is really helpful when completing code as it helps in avoiding errors and saving time helping the user to focus more on the logic as it is to be.
